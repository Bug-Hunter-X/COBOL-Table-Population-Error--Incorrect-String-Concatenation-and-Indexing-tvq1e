This repository demonstrates a common error in COBOL programs involving table population and string manipulation. The `bug.cob` file contains code that attempts to populate a table using an incorrect approach to string concatenation. This frequently leads to compilation errors or runtime exceptions such as subscript out of range or invalid string operation.  The `bugSolution.cob` provides a corrected version.
